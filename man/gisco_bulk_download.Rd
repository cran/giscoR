\arguments{
\item{id_giscoR}{Type of dataset to be downloaded. Values supported are
\code{"coastallines","communes","countries","lau","nuts","urban_audit"}.}

\item{year, cache_dir, update_cache, verbose, resolution}{See \link{gisco_get} for details.}

\item{ext}{Extension of the file(s) to be downloaded. Available formats are
\code{"geojson", "shp", "svg", "json", "gdb"}. See Details.}

\item{recursive}{Tries to unzip recursively the zip files (if any) included
in the initial bulk download (case of \code{ext = "shp"}).}

\value{
Silent function.

\description{
Downloads zipped data from GISCO and extract them on the
\code{cache_dir} folder.
}
\details{
The usual extension used across \pkg{giscoR} is \code{geojson},
however other formats are already available on GISCO.

This function helps building a personal shape library on \code{cache_dir}
(or \code{options(gisco_cache_dir = "path/to/dir")}, if set by the user).
}
\note{
For downloading specific files use \link{gisco_get} functions.
